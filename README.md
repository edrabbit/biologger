biologger
=========
Author: Ed Hunsinger

Biologger is intended to be a simple to use life logging tool for quantified self sort of tracking.
It's being designed primarily for my own use, but may be useful for others.

My goals:
* Should be easy and quick to use on an iPhone.
* User interface is bare bones for data input.
* Does not provide any analysis of data, merely records it.
* Logs to text files that are consumable by Splunk Storm.
